# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Design exploration for integrating AI coding agents into WordPress Studio. Goal: make Studio a "vibe coding workbench" where developers can use Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex CLI alongside their WordPress development workflow.

## Context

This is primarily a **design and documentation project** at this stage. Shaun's involvement is UI experimentation — exploring how agent interactions should look and feel within Studio.

The actual Studio codebase lives at `Automattic/studio`. This repo is for design artifacts, mockups, and documentation.

## Key Concepts

- **ACP (Agent Control Protocol)** — Standard for third-party agent integration
- **Telex CLI** — Artifact generation tooling
- **wpcom Sync** — Connecting local Studio work to WordPress.com

## Documentation

The `/docs/` folder contains:
- Design explorations
- UI mockups and rationale
- Meeting notes and decisions

## Scope

- **In scope**: UI/UX design for agent integration, design documentation, mockups
- **Out of scope**: Studio core development (that's in Automattic/studio)
