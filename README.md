# Studio Vibecoding

Design exploration for integrating AI coding agents into [WordPress Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/).

## What's here

Interactive prototypes exploring how AI-powered development workflows could work inside Studio — project management, chat interfaces, site previews, and agent interactions.

### projects-i0

Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript prototype of Studio's project management + AI chat interface.

```bash
cd prototypes/projects-i0
npm install
npm run dev  # http://localhost:3600
```

Includes 7 sample projects with mock sites, themes (with dark mode), and seed conversations demonstrating realistic AI assistant interactions.
