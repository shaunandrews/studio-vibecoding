# Site Builder System

The architecture that turns Studio from a prototype with mock data into an AI-powered site builder that creates real sites in real time.

---

## The Problem

Today, each mock site is a monolithic HTML string — a single function that returns the entire page. This has compounding problems:

- **Slow generation.** The AI must produce the complete HTML document in one shot. For a realistic page, this takes minutes.
- **Duplicated markup.** Every page repeats the nav, footer, font imports, and base styles. Change the nav? Change it in every page function.
- **No incremental rendering.** The preview is blank until the full document arrives. The user stares at a spinner.
- **No targeted editing.** "Change the hero image" requires regenerating the entire page. The AI must reproduce everything it didn't change, introducing drift and inconsistencies.
- **No shared design language.** Each page brings its own CSS. Colors, spacing, and component styles can diverge across pages of the same site.

## The Solution

A **section-based template system** with four layers:

```
Design Tokens  →  Component Library  →  Sections  →  Templates
(theme.json)      (reusable HTML/CSS)   (content blocks)  (page assembly)
```

### Layer 1: Design Tokens (exists today)

The `SiteTheme` type and `themeToCSS()` function. Colors, typography, spacing, and layout values defined once and consumed everywhere via CSS custom properties. This layer is done.

### Layer 2: Component Library

Reusable HTML/CSS patterns shared across all sections:

- **Navigation** — The site header/nav. Defined once, used on every page.
- **Footer** — Site footer. Same.
- **Button** — Primary, secondary, ghost variants.
- **Card** — Content container with optional image, title, text, action.
- **Image** — Responsive image with optional caption, aspect ratio, object-fit.
- **Menu item** — Name + price with dotted leader.
- **Event item** — Date badge + event details.
- **Team member** — Avatar + name + role + bio.

Components are CSS classes + HTML patterns. They reference only `var(--theme-*)` tokens, never hardcoded values. They're injected into every page via a shared `<style>` block, so sections can use them without re-declaring styles.

### Layer 3: Sections

The building blocks of a page. Each section is:

```ts
interface Section {
  id: string                    // unique within the page
  type: string                  // "hero-split", "image-strip", "menu-list", etc.
  data: Record<string, any>     // structured content for this section type
}
// Sections are ordered by their position in the page's sections array.
```

A section type defines:
- A **schema** — what data it accepts (title, images, items, etc.)
- A **renderer** — a function that takes the data + theme CSS and returns an HTML string
- **Component dependencies** — which components from Layer 2 it uses

The AI doesn't write HTML. It produces section data:

```json
{
  "type": "hero-split",
  "data": {
    "heading": "Downstreet Cafe",
    "tagline": "Your neighborhood coffee spot",
    "image": "/images/downstreet/hero-interior.png",
    "hours": ["Mon–Fri: 7am–6pm", "Sat–Sun: 8am–4pm"]
  }
}
```

The renderer turns this into HTML using the component library and theme tokens. The AI focuses on content and creative decisions. The system handles consistency.

**Section types for a café site might include:**
- `hero-split` — Image + text side by side
- `hero-fullwidth` — Full-width image with overlay text
- `hero-simple` — Text-only centered header
- `image-strip` — Row of images with captions
- `image-gallery` — Grid of images (various aspect ratios)
- `menu-list` — Category + items with prices
- `content-prose` — Long-form text (about page, blog post)
- `content-cards` — Grid of cards (values, features, services)
- `team-grid` — Team member cards
- `event-list` — Upcoming events with date badges
- `cta-banner` — Call-to-action block
- `contact-info` — Hours, location, phone, email
- `form-order` — Order interface with cart sidebar

### Layer 4: Templates

A template defines a page's structure:

```ts
interface PageTemplate {
  id: string               // "homepage", "menu", "about", etc.
  title: string
  slug: string
  parts: {
    header: string         // template part ID (e.g., "main-nav")
    footer: string         // template part ID (e.g., "site-footer")
  }
  sections: Section[]      // ordered list of content sections
}
```

The page renderer:
1. Outputs the HTML document shell (doctype, head, meta, font imports)
2. Injects theme CSS (`themeToCSS()`)
3. Injects the component library CSS
4. Renders the header template part
5. Renders each section in order
6. Renders the footer template part

**Template parts** (header, footer) are shared across all pages of a site. Change the nav once, it updates everywhere.

## How the AI Interacts

### Creating a site

The AI receives a creative brief (from the onboarding chat) and produces:

1. **Theme choices** — Color palette, fonts, spacing. Stored as `SiteTheme`.
2. **Template parts** — Nav items, footer content.
3. **Page definitions** — Which pages to create, what section types each uses.
4. **Section data** — The actual content for each section on each page.

Each of these can be generated independently and incrementally. The theme comes first (sets the visual foundation), then template parts (shared chrome), then sections (page content) — potentially in parallel across pages.

### Editing a site

The AI receives a user request and determines what to change:

- **"Change the colors to blue"** → Update the `SiteTheme`. All pages re-render automatically.
- **"Update the hero image"** → Generate new data for the `hero-split` section. Only that section re-renders.
- **"Add a testimonials section"** → Generate a new section, insert it at the right position in the template.
- **"Remove the events page"** → Delete the page template. Nav updates automatically.
- **"Change the nav to include a Shop link"** → Update the header template part. All pages reflect the change.

The scope of each change is clear and minimal. No full-page regeneration.

### AI System Prompt

The AI's system prompt defines:
- Available section types and their schemas
- Available components and how to reference them
- The current site's theme, template parts, and page structure
- How to return structured section data (fenced JSON blocks, similar to the card system)

## Progressive Rendering

When building a new site, the preview shows the page growing:

1. **Skeleton state** — Page loads with the document shell, theme CSS, and component CSS. Placeholder regions indicate where sections will appear.
2. **Header appears** — Nav renders as soon as template parts are generated.
3. **Sections stream in** — Each section appears as its data arrives. The hero loads first (it's the most visually impactful), then content sections top-to-bottom.
4. **Footer appears** — Last, after all content sections.

Between steps, the preview is functional — it's a real page that happens to be incomplete, not a loading screen. Sections could fade in or slide in as they arrive.

For editing, only the affected section re-renders. The rest of the page stays stable.

## New Project Flow

### The Modal (Onboarding)

A conversational mini-chat inside a modal:

1. **"What are you building?"** — Quick-reply buttons: Restaurant, Portfolio, Online Store, Blog, Something else. Clicking one pre-fills context; "Something else" opens free text.
2. **"What's it called?"** — Free text input for the site/business name.
3. **"Describe it in a sentence."** — Free text. This becomes the AI's creative brief. A short helper prompt: "Who's it for and what does it do?"

Three exchanges. The AI has enough to start building.

### The Transition

Modal closes. The sidebar shows the new project with a building indicator (the `StatusIndicator` component in "loading" state). The project view opens:

- **Chat panel** — The AI's first message acknowledges what it's building: "Setting up Downstreet Cafe — a neighborhood coffee shop site with a warm, inviting feel. I'll have something for you in a few minutes."
- **Preview panel** — Shows the progressive build state. Skeleton → header → hero → sections → footer.

### The Build-Time Chat

While sections generate (build time varies — could be a minute with fast models and parallelism, or several minutes for larger sites), the chat keeps the user productive:

- **Business details** — "What's the address? Phone number? Hours?" These feed directly into the contact-info section and footer.
- **Brand assets** — "Do you have a logo? An existing website I can reference?"
- **Content** — "Tell me about what makes this place special." This informs the about page prose.
- **Commercial** — "Want to connect a custom domain?" / "Need an email address for the business?"
- **Progress updates** — "Your homepage is looking good — take a peek. Working on the menu page next."

Every answer improves the site. The user isn't waiting — they're co-creating.

### Post-Build

Once all pages are generated, the AI signals completion: "Your site is ready. Here's what I built: 5 pages — Home, Menu, About, Events, Contact. What would you like to change?"

Now the user directs edits. The section system makes changes fast — modifying a single section instead of regenerating a page.

## Phases

This is a large project. Each phase builds on the previous one and delivers standalone value.

- **[Phase 1: Section System](./PHASE-1-SECTION-SYSTEM.md)** — Define section types, build the renderer, refactor Downstreet Cafe to use it. Prove the architecture.
- **[Phase 2: AI Generation Pipeline](./PHASE-2-AI-PIPELINE.md)** — Wire Claude to generate sections. Build progressive rendering. One end-to-end flow: describe a site → AI generates sections → site appears piece by piece.
- **[Phase 3: New Project Flow](./PHASE-3-NEW-PROJECT-FLOW.md)** — The onboarding modal, build-time chat, and project creation experience.
- **[Phase 4: Section Editing](./PHASE-4-SECTION-EDITING.md)** — User directs changes via chat. AI generates targeted section updates. Preview reflects changes in real time.

## What This Doesn't Cover

- **Real WordPress integration.** This system generates HTML for preview iframes, not actual WordPress blocks or theme files. The section types are inspired by WordPress patterns but aren't block markup. A future phase could map sections to actual Gutenberg blocks.
- **Image generation.** The system assumes images exist at URLs. How images are generated (AI, stock, upload) is a separate concern.
- **Hosting and deployment.** Building the site in the preview is step one. Getting it to a live URL is a separate pipeline.
- **Multi-user editing.** One user, one AI, one site at a time.
