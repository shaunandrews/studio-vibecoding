# Kit Onboarding & Input UX — February 17, 2026

## Summary

Reworked the new project onboarding flow with a named AI assistant (Kit), expanded type options, bottom-aligned chat messages, auto-focused input, and animated action buttons.

## AI Assistant: Kit

The onboarding AI now has a name—Kit. Each new project opens with a randomized greeting from a pool of five variations, followed by a capabilities overview and a prompt to pick a project type.

**Greeting flow (3 streamed messages):**
1. Random greeting (e.g. "Hey, it's Kit—your AI assistant.")
2. Capabilities: "I can design and build just about anything..."
3. Prompt: "So, what are we making?"

The messaging deliberately avoids saying "WordPress sites"—Kit is positioned as a general builder, not a WordPress-specific tool.

## Expanded Type Selection

Went from 5 type buttons to 10, ordered by real-world WordPress usage:

1. Business Site, 2. Online Store, 3. Blog, 4. Portfolio, 5. Restaurant, 6. Agency, 7. Nonprofit, 8. Membership, 9. Course, 0. Event

Removed "Something else" since the textarea placeholder already covers freeform input. New types (business, agency, nonprofit, membership, course, event) map to `custom` with appropriate `freeTextType` labels.

## Action Button Animations

Action buttons now animate into view with a staggered pop effect—each button fades in and slides up with 30ms delay between them (250ms duration, expo ease-out). Implemented via CSS `animation-delay` on wrapper spans, not Vue TransitionGroup.

## Keyboard Shortcut: 0 Key

Extended number key shortcuts from 1-9 to include 0 for the 10th action. Labels display as `0.` for the 10th item. Handles the `e.key === '0'` case mapping to index 9.

## Bottom-Aligned Messages

Made `.messages` container a flex column (`vstack` class) so the `margin-block-start: auto` on `.messages-inner` actually pushes messages to the bottom when there are fewer than a screenful. Previously the auto margin did nothing because the parent wasn't a flex container.

## Auto-Focus Chat Input

Added `onMounted(() => nextTick(() => inputChatRef.value?.focus()))` to AgentPanel so the chat input is focused whenever a project view mounts—covers both new projects and navigation to existing ones.

## Files Changed

- `src/components/composites/ChatMessageList.vue` — vstack on scroller, logical margin properties
- `src/components/composites/InputChat.vue` — 0 key shortcut, staggered animation wrappers + CSS
- `src/components/features/AgentPanel.vue` — onMounted auto-focus
- `src/data/types.ts` — trailing newline cleanup
- `src/data/useOnboarding.ts` — Kit name, randomized greetings, expanded type list, em dash cleanup
