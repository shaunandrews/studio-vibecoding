## 13:14 — Bond — Update

**Summary:** Architecture page completed + home view dark chrome treatment
**Changes:**
- `src/pages/Architecture.vue` — Replaced placeholder cards with real summaries from DATA-LAYER.md, ROUTING.md, COMPONENTS.md. Status updated to "Plans Complete ✅"
- `src/pages/ViewHome.vue` — Switched home view to dark chrome background (`--color-chrome`), updated project cards to use chrome-tier tokens (`--color-chrome-secondary`, `--color-chrome-border`) so they blend with the dark context
**Commits:** `74fb938`, `c900501`, `b35e7ad`
**Notes:** All three architecture plans (data layer, routing, components) are finalized. Home view is now fully dark-chrome themed.

## 16:14 — Bond — UI Polish Session

**Summary:** Panel toolbars, tab system, project chrome, resizable panels, chat centering

**Tab System:**
- Increased panel toolbar height (`py-xxs` → `py-xs`) and tab font size (`caption` → `body`)
- Tabs match button height (35px), close button uses `closeSmall` from `@wordpress/icons` instead of custom SVG
- Fixed Button component swallowing all click events (had `defineEmits<{ click }>` but never emitted — removed so native click falls through)
- New tabs labeled "New chat" instead of agent name
- + button sits inline after tabs, always visible (outside scroll wrapper with `flex: 0 1 auto`)
- Adding a tab focuses the chat input via exposed `focus()` method
- Per-tab draft text preserved via `v-model` on InputChat with drafts map in AgentPanel

**Project Chrome:**
- Titlebar shows "WordPress Studio • Project Name" via route params
- Browser tab title synced with titlebar
- WordPress favicon from `@wordpress/icons` replacing Vite logo
- `drawerRight` icon for site preview toggle

**Panels:**
- Resizable chat/preview split with drag handle, per-project width persisted in localStorage
- Per-project preview toggle state persisted in localStorage
- Chat messages and input always horizontally centered (720px max-width, `margin: 0 auto`)

**Key Fixes:**
- Button `defineEmits<{ click }>` was intercepting native click on ALL buttons app-wide — removed
- Route param is `:id` not `:projectId`
- Flex column children can't center with `margin: auto` when `align-items: stretch` — used inner wrapper with block layout instead
